# Notepad-Sharp
Notepad# is lightweight, minimalist notepad built for my potato laptop. With all the minimum features that I need. I needed a code editor that would not bug out on me from time to time (Even VSCode bugs out on my potato laptop).

This notepad project in mainly built for practicing programming, where there is No AI integration, no suggestions, and no auto-complete. Just pure syntax highlighting, automatic formatting, and a minimalist UI. The only buttons that you have is a save button and another button for a C# competitive programming template (Maybe I'll add more template soon).

You might say, "Christopher, Notepad++ already exists". Well...I hate the UI of Notepad++. So I decided to build something that I like aesthetically, and I like the minimalist aesthetic. And I don't want other features that I never even use so I want to build a notepad with the features that I just need.
